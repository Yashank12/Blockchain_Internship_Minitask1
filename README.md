# Blockchain_Internship_Minitask1

This repo contains a simulation of a basic blockchain system implemented in Python, demonstrating:

- ✅ Block creation and linking
- 🔁 Mining using Proof-of-Work (PoW)
- 🔐 Validator selection using PoW, PoS, and DPoS
- 📄 PDF document explaining blockchain concepts

## 🧪 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `blockchain_simulation.py` | Creates 3 linked blocks and shows hash tampering effect |
| `mining_simulation.py` | Simulates PoW by finding nonce with given difficulty |
| `consensus_demo.py` | Compares PoW vs PoS vs DPoS validator selection |
| `Mini Task 1.pdf` | Summary of concepts and diagrams |
